<p class="style1">Two distinct trends in the recent decade have been widely documented
in India - (a) one of the highest increases in per-capita alcohol consumption
worldwide and (b) a substantial jump in household debt and default
rates. In this paper, we examine whether, and the extent to which, the
former explains the latter. The panel structure of the India Human Development
Survey allows us to address unobserved heterogeneity at the
household level. In addition, we exploit the variation in alcohol sale and
consumption policies across the states of India to address the remaining
concerns of simultaneity and measurement error. Our estimates imply that
an additional expenditure of 1 INR on alcohol, increases a household's outstanding
debt by roughly 100 INR.We find further evidence that the ease of
borrowing and costs of defaulting determine the extent to which households
are willing to spend more on alcohol even at the cost of over-borrowing and
defaulting, suggesting the presence of moral hazard. </p>
