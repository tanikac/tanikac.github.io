<p class="style1">Determination of optimal monetary policy in the presence of corruption</p>
<p>This paper is an effort to merge two different lines of literature: general equilibrium approach to optimal taxation on one hand and the implication of bureaucratic corruption for optimal monetary policy on the other. We construct a pure exchange overlapping generations model where demand for money is endogenously determined. Our objective is to find the optimal mix of a lumpsum and seigniorage tax, needed to support an exogenous government spending, through a welfare maximizing criterion. We find that the presence of corruption generates a positive support for the use of inflation tax but only up to a threshold, after which it becomes imperative that the government addresses the institutional fundamentals.</p>
