<p class="style1">Public Economics (ECO 535) : Course Description </p>
<p>This is a course in the graduate public economics. This one-semester course covers issues like the role of
the government, provision of public goods, optimal design of tax and social policies, with emphasis on
combining theoretical models with empirical evidence. Topics include public goods and externalities,
efficiency costs and incidence of taxation, income taxation, transfer and welfare programs, and welfare
analysis in behavioral models. Microeconomics is a pre-requisite for this course. I also expect you to have
basic understanding of Econometric tools like OLS, Random and Fixed Effect models and Instrumental
Variables.
