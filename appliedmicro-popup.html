<p class="style1">Principles of Macroeconomics (ECO444) : Course Description </p>
<p>A central objective of this course is to analyze and assess empirical social science research. It
will build on topics covered in introductory econometrics courses, with a focus on the
application of methods to deal with empirical problems when working with real-world data.
Policies and programs in a broad range of areas will be examined, including labor, welfare and
poverty, development, health, education, and industry. Econometrics I is a pre-requisite for this
course. Below is a rough summary of the course structure. There might be materials covered in
the class which are not directly out of the text or slides and hence I would strongly encourage
you to attend all the classes.</p>
