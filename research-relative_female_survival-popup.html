<p class="style1">Impact of Industrialization on Relative Female Survival: Evidence from Trade Policies</p>
<p>This paper exploits an exogenous shift in the trade policy in India to study the impact of industrialization on son preference. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I find that households are more likely to have a male child in regions with higher trade openness relative to regions with lower in trade openness. Moreover, trade openness seems to have intensified son preference for the Hindus but not for the Muslim households. I further analyze the underlying mechanisms through which industrialization might have affected son preference. I find no significant evidence to suggest that household income or a change in female labor market opportunity affected relative female survival following trade liberalization. On the other hand, I find a significant increase in real dowry payments in regions experiencing greater trade openness. Most interestingly, dowry inflation is observed on for marriages in the Hindu households, but not in the Muslim households. The results are robust to falsification tests using cohorts born much before the liberalization period and are not driven by systematic migration into areas with greater trade openness.</p>
