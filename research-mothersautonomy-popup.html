<p class="style1">Mother's Autonomy and Child Welfare - A New Measure and Some New Evidence</p>
<p>Existing literature on the effects of a mother's autonomy on her child's welfare assumes that greater income for women automatically translates into greater autonomy in decision making. However, it is not generally known if a dollar earned by a woman is spent by her own volition or at the discretion of her other family member(s) since the exact process of who decides what remains unobservable to researchers. We address this by creating an autonomy index from the principal components of a variety of household decision variables and ?nd that greater autonomy for mother leads to better schooling outcome only for young boys; not girls. Our fndings are similar when we use alternative defnitions of autonomy and correct for the potential endogeneity of mothers decision by an instrumental variable strategy. These mixed results also caution against the growing popularity of gender-directed cash-transfer policies.</p>
